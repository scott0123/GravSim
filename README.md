## Mathematics
All operations are done under a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system with

* the positive x direction pointing to the right of the screen
* the positive y direction pointing to the top of the screen
* the positive z direction protruding out of the screen

The model operates under the assumption that the only force each planetary body is subject to at any point in time is purely gravitational in nature. The only exception to this rule is when two bodies collide, at which point alternative forces will be present.
